## Nazi Notes

[Nazi Standards](http://www.aam-us.org/resources/ethics-standards-and-best-practices/collections-stewardship/objects-during-the-nazi-era)

Objects that should be considered to have possible Nazi Era provenance will have the following attributes:

* Date of Creation<= 1946
* Date of Acquisition>= 1932   
* Has change of ownership between 1932 and 1946
* Was or could reasonably be thought to have been continental Europe between 1932 and 1946
* Initial area of focus, per the AAM and the AAMD is Paintings and Judaica (i.e. Torah crowns, torah scrolls, menorah, Shabbat candle sticks, Chumash, etrog boxes, natia, shofar, Tanach, yad…I’m sure there’s tons I’m missing).
 
So that’s the minimum criteria that the AAM has set out for identifying things with possible Nazi Era provenance. Museums are “strongly encouraged” to make these items public on their websites, and to use www.nepip.org to list them (which we do/did, though not all in our collection have made it on to this truly terribly website). I took the info from our museum and typed it in to a much more searchable form here, and there’s a group in KE that is called “Works not currently in NEPIP”: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EWxoz3DkPKFKPbN8XwMe405t2MlTzZsvUNYw-swI6rA/edit?usp=sharing>

There’s also things like this: <http://www.lootedart.com/MVI3RM469661>   (scroll to the subhead of “ALIU LIST OF RED FLAG NAMES”). We should maybe considered an additional search for those names in provenance…
Not sure that this is anything different, but it may have different names…
