## Period and Range Specificity. 

When talking about provenance, the level of uncertainty about the dates of a transfer is often communicated using specific phrases.  Additionally, for each owner, there are two transfers- the transfer **to** the owner and the transfer **away** from the owner.  Typically, provenance only is concerned with the transfer **to** the owner—the transfer away is captured by the following line.  However, when the next party is unknown, often we have to record the information for both transfers in a single line. If needed, many of these forms can be combined to convey both transfers.  If so, the transfer **to** the party appears before the transfer away, without a comma between. 

To help illustrate what we're talking about, each phrase is followed by up to four dates. The first two dates indicate the possible range of dates that the transfer **to** the party could have happened, and the following two indicate the range of dates that the transfer **from** the party could have happened.

For example: 

    1995-1999...2000-2004
    
means that the painting was acquired no earlier than 1995 and no later than 1999, and that it was sold no earlier than 2000 and no later than 2004.


    ????-1999...????-????

means that we know that the painting was acquired no later than 1999, but that we don't know when before that date it was acquired, and we don't know anything about the transfer **from** the party.

    1995-1995...????-????

means that we know the painting was acquired in 1995, but we are not talking about (or don't know) about the transfer *from* the party.

### John Doe, 1995 *or* John Doe, on Dec 15, 1995

    1995-1995...????-????

This work was transferred *to*  John *in* 1995.  Use this when the exact date is known, with as much specificity as is known.  The **on 1995** form is discouraged.


Use this **either** if the following transfer is a direct transfer **or** the following transfer is indirect, but the date when the transfer from John is unknown.



###John Doe, before 1995 *or* John Doe, by 1995 *or* John Doe, as of 1995
 
    ????-1995...????-????

The work was transferred *to* John *before* 1995.  Use this when you know that John owned the work by 1995 and that the acquisition was prior to that. The "**as of**" form is discouraged.

Technically, **by 1995** means that it could have happened in 1995 or sometime before, whereas **before 1995** means that it did not happen in 1995, but sometime before.  For the purposes of data modeling, this distinction is too fine.  Put it in a note.


### John Doe, after 1995

    1995-????...????-????

The work was transferred *to* John *after* 1995.  Use this when you know that John **did not** possess the work in 1995, but did sometime after 1995.


### John Doe, until 1995

    ????-????...1995-1995

The work was owned by John until 1995 and there is a definite record of the transfer *from* John *to* another party in 1995.  

This should only be used when you know that the work was transferred, but you don't know to whom—otherwise, it is implied in the following record.

### John Doe, until sometime after 1995 *or* John Doe, until at least 1995 

    ????-????...1995-????

The work was owned by John in 1995, and transferred sometime after 1995.  The "**until sometime after**" form is preferred.

This should only be used when something is known both about the acquisition and about the transfer from John, in conjunction with a statement about the acquisition.  

For example, **"John Doe, 1990 until sometime after 1995"**.  

Otherwise,  **"John Doe, before 1995"** conveys the same information and is preferred.

### John Doe, until sometime before 1995

    ????-????...????-1995
    
The work was **not** owned by John in 1995, and was transferred sometime prior to 1995.  The "**until sometime before**" form is preferred.


### John Doe, in 1995

    ????-1995...1995-????
    
The work was known to be in John's possession in 1995, but nothing is known about the transfer to or transfer from John.

### John Doe, between 1995 and 1996 *or* John Doe, between 1995-1996

    1995-1995...1996-1996

We know both the exact transfer to and from John, but do not know the party that the work was transferred **to**.  If the party is known, the transfer from is implied and "**John Doe, 1995**" is sufficient.
