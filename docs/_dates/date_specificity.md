## Date Specificity

When writing dates for provenance, it's important to state the level of accuracy desired.  As such, we have defined specific formats for writing dates with varying levels of precision.  The preferred form is the correct way to write the datesâ€”the alternate forms are supported, but are not recommended and should be converted into the preferred form.

The following phrasings for dates are preferred for each level of specificity:

### Known to the Century

**Preferred Form:** the 19th century, the 1st century CE, the 2nd century BCE  
**If Uncertain:** the 19th century?, the 8th century BCE?  
**Alternate Forms:** 19th century, 20th Century ad, 19 Century, 4th century BC

Century should always be lowercase.   When referencing centuries before 10th century CE, it is helpful to explicitly include CE.  When referencing centuries BEFORE the first century CE, it is mandatory to include BCE.

Centuries are defined as the years starting with 01 and ending with 00.  For instance, the 18th century is the period between 1801 and 1900.  For BCE centuries, the same holds:  the 8th century BCE is the period between 701 BCE and 800 BCE.

### Known to the Decade

**Preferred Form:** the 1990s  
**If Uncertain:** the 1990s?  
**Alternate Forms:** 1990s, 1990s CE, the 1990s AD

Decades are not a common form for dates, but are often used for (relatively) recent dates.  This form is valid for all decades between the 100s CE and the current date. It is not valid to use this form for dates before 100 CE.

### Known to the Year

**Preferred Form:** 1990, 900 CE, 800 BCE  
**If Uncertain:** 1990?, 900 CE?, 800 BCE?  
**Alternate Forms:**  10 ad, 1 BC, 6000 BCE, 800

BCE is mandatory for years before 1 CE. CE is required when the year is earlier than 1000 CE. CE is strongly preferred (mandatory, but not enforced?) when other dates within the record are BCE.

#### Known to the Month

**Preferred Form:** October 1990, October 990 CE     
**If Uncertain:** October 1990?  
**Alternate Forms:** June 2000 CE, March 880, January 80, aug. 1995, 'August, 1995', 'Aug., 1995'

CE is strongly preferred when the year is earlier than 1000 CE. BCE is not currently supported.

**TODO:** Does known to the month make sense for dates BCE?

#### Known to the Day

**Preferred Form:** June 11, 1995; June 11, 880 CE; June 11, 880 BCE  
**If Uncertain:** June 11, 1990?  
**Alternate Forms:**  June 11 1995; Oct. 17, 1980; June 15, 90 BCE; 9 June 1932; 9 June, 1932; 10/17/1980; 1980-17-10


#### More Precise

*Specificities more accurate than the day are over-precise for the project, and also might introduce time-zone requirements into the specification.  At this point, we do not support precisions greater than a day.*
